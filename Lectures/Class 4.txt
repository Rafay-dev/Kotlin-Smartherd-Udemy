* Basic Syntax:
	
	var name: String
	
	name = "Steve"
	
	display(name)
	
fun display(name: String){

		print(name)

	}
	
	
* Creating Class Object:
	
	* We don't need to use "new" keyword to create object in "Kotlin"
	
	var person = Person()
	
* Concatenation:
	We can concatenate "String" with "Variable" by using "+" sign
