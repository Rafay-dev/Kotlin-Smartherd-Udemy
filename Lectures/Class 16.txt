LECTURE 53:

 - MAP:
	A collection that holds pairs of objects (keys and values) and supports efficiently retrieving the value corresponding to each key. Map keys are unique; the map holds only one value for each key. Methods in this interface support only read-only access to the map; read-write access is supported through the MutableMap interface.
	
	Entry:
	 Represents a key/value pair held by a Map
