LECTURE 23:

LOOP CONTROL STATMENTS:

	* Break Statement
	* Continue Statement
	* Return Statement


	- Break and Continue Labels:
		Any expression in Kotlin may be marked with a label. Labels have the form of an identifier followed by the @ sign, for example: abc@, fooBar@ are valid labels (see the grammar). To label an expression, we just put a label in front of it
		
		EXAMPLE:
		
		myLoop@ for (i in 1..100) {
			for (j in 1..100) {
				if (...) break@myLoop
			}
		}
		
		
	- Continue Statement:
		This statement can be used in "Loop" to skip the part of the condition then continue the loop.
		
		EXAMPLE:
		
		// Print 1 to 5 and skip 4
		
		for (1..5){
			if(1==4){
				continue // 4 will be skip
			}
		}
