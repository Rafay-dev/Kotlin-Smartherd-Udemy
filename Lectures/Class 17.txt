		Defination:
			By defination of OOP, a class is a blueprint of runtime entity and object is its state, which include both its behaviour and state. 
				
			In Kotlin, class declaration consists of a class header and a class body surrounded by curly braces, similar to Java.
			
		Syntax:
			Class myClass{
				// class body
			}
			
		Class Constructor:
			Class myClass(name:String){
				// name is a primary constructor
				
				// init Block
					// Your class initializer code (This will run first)
			}
			
TOPICS:

			* init Block
			* Primary Constructor with Property
			* Primary Constructor with Just Parameters
			* Secondary Constructor
