LECTURE 16:

- RANGES:

	Example:
	
Ascending Order:
		
* ".."
	This is known as "Double Dot Operator". It is used to print "Range" in ascending order
	
	Example:
	
	val r1 = 1..5
	
	// This range contains the number between 1 to 5
	
	
Descending Order:
	
* "downTo"
	It is used to print "Range" in ascending order
	
	Example:
	
	val r2 = 5 downTo 1
	
	// This range contains the number between 5 to 1
	
	
Skipping Values:

* "step"
	It is used to skip the alternate value
	
	Example:

	val r3 = 5 downTo 1 step 2
	
	// This range contain values 5, 3, 1


Search In Range:
	
* "in"
	It is used to search in "Range"
	
	Example:
	
	val r4 = 'a'..'z'
	
	// This range contains the all the alphabets from "a to z"
	
	val isPresent = 'c' in r4
	
	// It will search letter 'c' in "a to z" range
